# Description

This repository presents the implementation of an avl_tree class, a self-balancing binary search tree, in C++. The class ensures efficient data insertion, deletion, and access operations while maintaining the balance of the tree for optimal search times. Key functionalities demonstrated through the project include:

-Dynamic Data Management: Allows for the insertion and removal of key-info pairs, adapting the tree structure to maintain balanced conditions.

-Data Access: Implements access to the info associated with a specific key.

Additionally, the project introduces two notable function templates:

wordCounter Function: Builds a dictionary from an input stream (like a text file), mapping words to their frequency of occurrence. This is exemplified using "text.txt", comparing the performance of avl_tree with the standard library's map in terms of execution time for counting word occurrences.

This avl_tree class implementation showcases advanced data structure usage, template programming, and performance analysis, providing a robust foundation for managing and analyzing structured data efficiently.
